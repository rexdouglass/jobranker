## The Data:

The repository includes a demostration DuckDB database as well as publically facing google sheets for the inpust seed urls and output job rankings. The reliability of either is subject to change and the user is encouraged to generate their own examples from scratch on a fresh run.

 * zero_shot_classifier.py - NLP pipeline for zero shot classification of text into categories
 * link_classifier.py - Logic for classifying links as "To a job posting" or not.
2. Post Extractor
 * question_answering.py - NLP pipeline for question answering from short spans of text.
 * post_feature_extraction.py - Applies question answering to job posts to extrcat and clean key facts
3. Poster Ranker
